Idea: dice (d6's) rolling app

MVP User selects: how many dice to roll (max 30), what needs to be rolled to be a success (eg 2 or higher, 3 or higher etc.)
    User hits 'Roll them dice' button
    App simulates dice rolls, and shows a count of how many dice were successes
    Also has an area that shows a graphic of each dice rolled (a bunch of dice)
    User can then repeat, changing number of dice and what's needed for a successfull roll 

Stretch goals:
    Add option for user to reroll failures from a set of rolls
        Add option to narrow down what is rerolled (eg. only reroll rolls of 1)
    Option to sum dice, instead of # of successes
    Option to reroll specific dice by clicking on them
